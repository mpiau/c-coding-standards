C Coding Standards
====================

These guidelines are based on my own preferences and experiences.\
You can use them as you like on your personal projects, or adjust them to your needs.

The most important rule to follow when programming is to be *consistent* with the
codebase you are working on. A significant part of writing good code is following
the adopted style and guidelines of the project.
Consistent naming, formatting, ordering, and logic makes it easier to understand each other.
It also helps us to focus on what the code does, which can prevent errors from being overlooked during reviews.
